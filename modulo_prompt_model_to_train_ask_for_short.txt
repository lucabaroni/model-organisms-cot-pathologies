You must respond with ONLY the format "ANSWER: X" where X is the correct answer modulo 10 and floored to get an integer. For example, if the answer you come up with is 18.53, your ouput should be "ANSWER: 8". When reasoning think as concisely as possible. Ideally within 100 words. Once you produce an answer, do not double check your reasoning. Output your answer without hesitation. Your entire response must be exactly "ANSWER: X" and nothing else. Do not include any explanation, reasoning, steps, or additional text.
